	  <h2>Overview</h2>
	  <br />
	  <p>Welcome to my website, where I provide detailed walkthroughs on how to solve various Capture the Flag (CTF) challenges. My focus is on web, OSINT, binary, and Root Me challenges.</p>
	  <p>On my website, you will find a variety of resources to help you improve your skills and knowledge in the field of cybersecurity. My walkthroughs cover a wide range of topics, including web application security, network exploitation, and reverse engineering.</p>
	  <p>My web challenge walkthroughs cover a wide range of topics, including SQL injection, cross-site scripting, and file inclusion vulnerabilities.</p>
	  <p>For OSINT challenges, I provide walkthroughs on how to gather and analyze public information, such as social media profiles, website data, and news articles. These walkthroughs will help you develop your skills in data gathering, reconnaissance, and open-source intelligence gathering.</p>
	  <p>My binary challenge walkthroughs cover topics such as reverse engineering, binary exploitation, and binary analysis. I provide detailed explanations of various tools and techniques for analyzing and exploiting binary code, including disassembly and debugging.</p>
	  <p>I also provide walkthroughs for Root Me challenges, which are focused on privilege escalation, network security, and system administration. These walkthroughs will help you develop your skills in Linux and Windows system administration, as well as network security and penetration testing.</p>
	  <p>I hope that you find my website to be a valuable resource as you work to improve your skills and knowledge in the field of cybersecurity. If you have any questions or feedback, please feel free to contact me.</p>
	  <p>Thank you for visiting my website and I hope you enjoy your journey in learning Capture the Flag challenges.</p>
